# Horseshoe-Measurement-Prediction
This project develops a neural network model to predict the external curve length of horseshoes based on input attributes: internal curve length, width, and cord length. Implemented in MATLAB, the model uses backpropagation with a [5, 10] layer configuration, achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.047 and 100% accuracy,
